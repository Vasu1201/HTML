    <h1>Principal Message</h1>
	<P>The beginning of any journey decides where you want to go. The fundamental and basic step in achieving<br> the cherished dream of any individual is in deciding and determining what you want to achieve and the way you chart<br> out the best route to reach that destination. It is equally same for an educational institution. The longest journey<br> begins with the first step. Once started, it is the restless force of enthusiasm, dedication hard work and co-operation<br> of all who are associated,which leads the institution to achieve the set goal.<br></P> 

    <p>This reminds me of Mr.Narayan Murthyâ€™s success story. Mr.Murthy started off Infosys Technology in 1981 with a <br>negligible capital of Rs.10,000/- saved by his wife Sudha. It was their vision backed by perseverance, firm <br>determination and hard work thatpaved the way for the company to be one of the top global I.T. Companies.<br></p>

    <p>An educational institution is to be visualized as a global<br> entity with an underlyingresponsibility to create global leaders who craves for the overall developmentof the social human being, social peace harmony.<br> Success is never cquired through easy ways. It is the result ofcalculated risks and optimum use of the opportunities. Looking back <br>i.e. the journey from 1983, we feel contended with the growth of the Institution. Yet, we realize that there <br>is much more to do.<br></p>
