	<p style="font-family: cursive;">Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself~ John Dewey
Education is the heartthrob of any civilized society.In 1942, when India was still under colonial rule, the need of education became all the more crucial. Realizing this the visionaries of Malad and Kandivli areas came together and established Malad Kandivli Education Society. Harbouring the dream ofproviding high standard education, Malad Kandivli Education Society founded Sheth Nahalchand Laloochand High School in 2008-2009<br></p>
 
     <p style="font-family: cursive;">Dedicated to the cause of education; the Malad Kandivli Education Society expanded its branches and established many new educational institutions. It has groomed many young minds into responsible citizens over these many years. Thousands of students have gone out of its portals and today occupy important positions in the Society. In its 60 years of existence, the society has achieved many milestones and one such significant milestone of the Society was the establishment of the College in July 2009<br></p>

     <p style="font-family: cursive;">The College was started with three classes of commerce by creating wooden partitions in the dilapidated hall without any government grant and in the very first year, 330 students enrolled. In the next year, College was shifted to the present building. In 2014, Arts stream was commenced and the senior College was named as ‘Beyond Infinity College of Commerce and Arts’ and the Junior College was named as ‘The Bombay Suburban Grain Dealers’ Junior College of Commerce and Arts’. After 5 year of its existence,the college received the grant from the government. The College ran in two sessions morning and evening for nearly a decade. In 2012,the evening session was scraped and the degree College ran full-fledged in morning and the Junior College ran in the afternoon session.<br></p>

     <p style="font-family: cursive;">Affiliated to the University of Mumbai, the College has shown tremendous growth in a short span of time. More than 6500 students are studying in it and taking benefit from various courses offered by the College. The courses offered are:<br></p>
